# Rancid Tomatillos!

## Overview of Project 
### Description
Rancid Tomatillos was a partner project that was assigned in Mod3 of Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End Engineering bootcamp. The students for this project were challanged to create an application that displays a list of movies which once selected it will display all that movies details. We built this whole application with react and tested all of our information with cypress testing. We also used routing to change our URL when a link is clicked.



### Goals
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed.
- Implement react methods throughout the whole application. 
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Implement a robust testing suite using Cypress testing.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Using the local server and changing the URL name depending on the page we are on.
- Implement best practices for accessibility

## Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React
- Cypress Testing
- Fetch API
- GitHub project board
- ARIA
- WAVE Evaluation Tool
- Google Lighthouse

## Installation Instructions:
### Run the local server
- In your terminal, clone 'git@github.com:turingschool-examples/fitlit-api.git' and CD into the directory.
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` in to start the local server.
- To stop the local server from running in your terminal use `command + c`.

### Wins
- Using class and function components
- Completion of all Cypress testing
- Correctly using routing method
- Adding Deployment to our application

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
